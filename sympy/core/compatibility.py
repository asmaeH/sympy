# These are in here because telling if something is an iterable just by calling
# hasattr(obj, "__iter__") behaves differently in Python 2 and Python 3.  In
# particular, hasattr(str, "__iter__") is False in Python 2 and True in Python 3.
# I think putting them here also makes it easier to use them in the core.

    Return a boolean indicating whether i is an iterable in the sympy sense.

    When sympy is working with iterables, it is almost always assuming
    that the iterable is not a string or a mapping, so those are excluded
    by default. If you want a pure python definition, make exclude=None. To
    exclude multiple items, pass them as a tuple.

    Examples:

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import iterable
    >>> from sympy import Tuple
    >>> things = [[1], (1,), set([1]), Tuple(1), (j for j in [1, 2]), {1:2}, '1', 1]
    >>> for i in things:

    True <type 'list'>
    True <type 'tuple'>
    True <type 'set'>

    True <type 'generator'>
    False <type 'dict'>
    False <type 'str'>
    False <type 'int'>
