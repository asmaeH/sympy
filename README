$ git clone git://github.com/hazelnusse/pydy.git

1. Documentation and usage
--------------------------
This is a work in progress.  Much more will be added here as the project
matures.  Eventually, the project will have a Google code project page, either
within the Sympy page or a stand alone, separate project page.

2. Project goals
--------------------------
To allow for easy manipulation of three-dimensional vectors for the purpose of
deriving equations of motion.  In particular, PyDy is designed to implement
Kane's method for forming the equations of motion.  Numerical integration of
the equations of motion are provided by scipy.integrate.odeint.  PyDy has builtin
functionality that allows for easy animation of reference frames, points, rigid
bodies and particles.
